Unemployment Analysis:

📌 Project Overview:
This project, developed as part of my internship at CodeAlpha, provides an in-depth analysis of unemployment data. It utilizes a Jupyter Notebook (Unemployment_Analysis.ipynb) to explore key metrics, identify trends, and analyze the impact of significant events like the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates.

⚙️ Tech Stack:
This project leverages the following Python libraries for data processing, visualization, and analysis:

1.Python
2.Pandas, NumPy
3.Matplotlib, Seaborn
4.Statsmodels

🚀 Features:
The Unemployment_Analysis.ipynb notebook demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, including:
Data Loading and Cleaning: The notebook loads the Unemployment.dataset.csv file, handles duplicates, and preprocesses the data by parsing dates and converting unemployment rates to a numeric format.
Trend and Impact Analysis: The project visualizes the overall unemployment rate trend and specifically analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by segmenting the data into pre-COVID, COVID, and post-COVID periods.

Seasonal Decomposition: The notebook performs seasonal decomposition on the unemployment rate time series to identify seasonal patterns.

Key Statistics: It computes and displays key statistics such as the overall minimum, maximum, and mean unemployment rates, and identifies local peaks.
